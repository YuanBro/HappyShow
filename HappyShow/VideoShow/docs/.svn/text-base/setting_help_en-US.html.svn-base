<h4>1) How can i create video quickly?</h4>
Currently, 'quick mode' is supported in 2 cases:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Make music video.  First, select one video; Second, select one music(optional, you can record a voice at the same time); Third, save video. It's very quick, try it!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Trim video:   Use the "Fast trim" in Toolbox.<br/>  
<h4>2) Is my video safe? Will anyone see my private video?</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on..Videoshow is just a video editing tool, you can do anything without internet.  Only when you share video to Instagram and hashtag #videoshowapp,   your video will get a chance to be featured and shown in the "Feature list".<br/>

<h4>3) Exporting video is so slow...</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Video transcoding is a CPU-consuming work. In general, the longer the video is, the longer exporting time needs.  We are still trying to optimize the performance of exporting.  <br/>

<h4>4) I can not save video</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the most common bug which we are tring to fix.  If you see such problem, please send the detail(repro steps, phone model,android version) to <a href="mailto:support@enjoy-mobi.com" target="_blank">support@enjoy-mobi.com</a>.     Btw, try some other video/music, try reboot the app or even the phone, the bug may dissapear.<br/> 

<h4>5) I can not share video.</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the video is deleted by Facebook,  please check the copyright of the music you add. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- If you can not upload the video, please send the detail(the social platform you share, phone model, android version) to  <a href="mailto:support@enjoy-mobi.com" target="_blank">support@enjoy-mobi.com</a> .<br/>

 Thank you.<br/>
